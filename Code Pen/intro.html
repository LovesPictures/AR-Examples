air time uses encoded visual markers in the vicinity of America Ground to tell an unfolding story from data, designed to tell a story in two parts.
 <br></br>                                                                                               
firstly, the visual markers reveal immediate parts of the story in short narratives told through Augmented Reality. 
<br></br> 
secondly, the placement of markers at intersecting points in the space leads us through map coordinates to other places in the urban space, where concealed in the bungaroosh are other unremembered stories, untold.
 <br></br>     
 go to poster &#x2460 in America Ground to find markers to the past, take screenshots while using the work, email pictures to the artist
