  <p>                                                                                           
I am an exhibiting artist researcher and lecturer in creative coding. <br></br>  I uses the city’s immaterial patterns and inter-dependencies, to tell stories from data related to surveillance, migration and the bio-metric aesthetics of the body. Past projects were created using combinations of facial detection, motion detection, QR codes, photography, sound, and moving image.
